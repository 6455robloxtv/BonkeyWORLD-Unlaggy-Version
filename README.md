# BonziWORLD

Just made a revival of the BonziWORLD classic v1.4.2 server.
New shoutouts to:
- HeyJoeWay
- Seamus
- Loliest Huhytre
- DonutScout
- BonziCITIZEN
- and so much more
- No shoutouts for all assholes because they are responible for contributing to the hell hole named bonziworld.org

This shitty server i made should be used by bonziworld.com users, i hope.

## Dependencies
- Node.js and npm
- Ruby
- Sass
- Git
- Cordova (Optional)

## Setup
In a terminal/command prompt, navigate to where you'd like BonziWORLD to be placed and run the following:
```
git clone https://github.com/ItzUltraChace/BonziWORLD-v1.4.2
cd BonziWORLD v1.4.2
```

### Client
```
cd src
npm install
grunt build_www
cd ..
```

### Server
```
cd server
npm install
node index.js
```
After this, BonziWORLD will be accessible on port 80. (http://localhost/)

## Disclaimer
I'm not responsible if you screw up anything with your computer while setting this up. I have no idea how you would, but someone will find a way. I also will not provide support for installing dependencies. If you have everything installed properly, the above commands will work.
